# App User Sync
- When your users send messages from other platforms (iOS and Android), they will now be synced with the SDK in real-time. 

# Bug Fixes
- Whispers that are sent on the `App is Launched` event will now trigger a `message:received` event.
- Action buttons will now use the secondary color that you picked in the Smooch dashboard.
- Fixed regression where the SDK was no longer sending the `x-smooch-sdk` header.

# Upgrades
- Upgraded Font Awesome to 4.5.0
- Upgraded `smooch-core` to 1.1.2

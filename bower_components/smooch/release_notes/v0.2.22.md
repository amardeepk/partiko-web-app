![Email capture](http://docs.supportkit.io/images/email_capture.gif)

- Email capture support:  you can now ask your users to provide their email address in case you miss them by passing `emailCaptureEnabled: true` in the options in `SupportKit.init(options)`. Once enabled, they will be asked in a non-obtrusive way to provide their email address after sending their first message. If you provided that information at initialization, everything will work as before. You can retrieve that information using the `!profile` command in Slack.

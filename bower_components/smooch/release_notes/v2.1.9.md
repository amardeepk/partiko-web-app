# Changes
- You can now listen to more events now! Your app can now know when the widget opens or closes.
- Even if you're not listening to those events, you can now know the widget state by calling `Smooch.isOpened()`.
- The widget will now properly clean up after itself when it gets destroyed. No more ghost event bindings!
- Unread count wasn't reset when the user typed something, now it is!
- You can now try to force a conversation refresh if you created the conversation via the API by calling `Smooch.getConversation()`. If a conversation was created and the widget was not yet connected to the websockets, it will connect and return the conversation.

# Smooch 2.0

SupportKit is now [Smooch](https://smooch.io)!

With Smooch, the internals of the SDK have changed. It is now using our [public API](http://docs.smooch.io/rest/) and as such we've bumped the major version to 2.0.

## Changes
- The Web SDK API changes for Smooch (please check the [upgrade guide](#upgrade-guide))
- The Web SDK is now using the new [public API](http://docs.smooch.io/rest/)
- Added support for user id with `/` and other URL breaking characters

## Upgrade guide

### CDN

To get the new version, you should now include this script in your page :

```html
<script src="https://cdn.smooch.io/smooch.min.js"></script>
```

You can still use the old CDN link, but that package won't get updated. It will stay in v1.0.

### Packages

The package is now named `smooch` on npm and bower.

```
$ npm install smooch

$ bower install smooch
```

### API

The most notable change is that you no longer use the `SupportKit` global variable, but the new `Smooch` global.

```javascript
var Smooch = require('smooch');

Smooch.init({appToken: 'your_app_token'});
```

The rest is pretty much the same! We didn't change the CSS classes, so your customization should be safe.

# New Stuff
- The widget will now play a [sound notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smooch/smooch-js/844226ad6560c5bf6277826dd512fe05a0469c18/src/assets/new-message.mp3) whenever a new message comes in and the window is out of focus. Your users will never miss a message again!
- In addition to the new sound, the window title will also animate to notify people who have their sound muted.


# Bug fixes
- Conversation will be marked as started as soon as a user sends a message. This solves a problem where the websockets weren't connected in time to get first message whispers or out of office hours messages.

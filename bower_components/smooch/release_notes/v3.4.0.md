# What's new?
- Your conversations are now paginated! The widget should now work better with the long conversations you have with your users. Once they scroll up their history the next batch of messages will load.
- We improved the way CSS is handled in the widget and now the general input still shouldn't affect the inputs of the widget.
- Using the widget with webpack should now be easier. We vendored in `load-image` and added some tweaks to make `faye` behave correctly when the widget is built using webpack.

# Display mode : button
At last, the widget can now be displayed as a floating button when closed. This should take a bit less real estate on your website and we believe it looks really nice! You can now also choose your brand color which will allow you to customize the header and button color.

If you already have the widget configured and want to use these new features, just head to your Smooch dashboard and change them in your Web Messaging settings.

Happy customization!

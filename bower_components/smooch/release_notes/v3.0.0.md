## Connect with your users on more messaging channels

With the Web Messenger, your users can message you using whatever channel they wish. With some magic behind the scene, Smooch will present these unified channels as a single conversation in your chat system/CRM.

If a user starts chatting with you and would like to continue the chat on another messaging channel such as Facebook Messenger, WeChat or Telegram, they will have the option to link their Facebook account and continue that same conversation.

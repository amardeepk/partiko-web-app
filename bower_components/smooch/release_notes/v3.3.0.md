Start a conversation on the web messenger... and then continue on your phone! :tada: This will be enabled in the web messenger if you have the Twilio integration set up.

## User linking on the Web Messenger
User linking allows users to continue a conversation on another messaging channel such as Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Telegram, or SMS. The context is preserved and the conversation will appear as one in your chat system/CRM. Learn more about user linking [here](http://docs.smooch.io/javascript/#user-linking).

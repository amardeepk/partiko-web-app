You can now request money from your users. Payments are handled through [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), and setup is extremely simple. Read all the details [in our docs](http://docs.smooch.io/javascript/#stripe).


## Changes
- The widget was fully rewritten using React and Redux. The public API is exactly the same.
- In addition to the `message:received` and `message:sent` events, it also publishes a more generic `message` whenever a new message is added to the conversation. You can check who sent that message by checking the `role` attribute for the message.
- The unread badge count was fixed to reflect the right count.
- All API calls are now made by our new library [smooch-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smooch-core) which abstracts all interactions with our public API.
- The `z-index` of the widget was brought down to a sane level (9998). It should now appear under your modal's backdrop and not distract your users.

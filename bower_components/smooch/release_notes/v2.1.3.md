# Changes
- `Smooch.init`, `Smooch.login`, and `Smooch.logout` will now return the `user`. It will also be available in the `ready` event callback.
- Fixed the `message:received` event where a message from an app user was marked as `received` and not `sent`.
- smooch-core was updated to 0.0.14
- The test suite for Stripe component was improved.

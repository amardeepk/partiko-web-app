Introduction</h3> <p> 1.1 These are the terms of use, including the terms and conditions of supply (<b>Terms</b>), for www.Partiko.com and the Partiko application. For the purposes of these Terms, both the website and application shall be referred to as the "<b>App</b><span>"</span>. The App is operated by Partiko Services Private Ltd trading as Partiko (<b>we</b>, <b>us </b>and <b>our</b>). We are a Private limited company, registered in New Delhi, India. </p> <p> 1.2 Your use of the App and your Purchase of any of the Bookings/Tickets offered via our App is subject to these Terms and by placing an order for any Bookings/Tickets you agree to be bound by them. You should print a copy of these Terms for future reference. Use of your personal information submitted via this App is governed by our privacy policy. </p> <p> 1.3 We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time by changing them on the App, although no such change will affect any Purchase you have already made with us. Your continued use of the App and any new Purchases will be bound by the new Terms. These Terms were last updated on June 30, 2015. </p> <p> 1.4 As a consumer, nothing in these Terms will prevent you or stop you from being able to enforce or receive the full benefit of your legal rights provided under general law. </p> <p> 1.5 In these Terms we use various capitalised terms (they are "defined"). This means they have special meanings, found in the next-to-last section of these Terms. </p> <h3 style="padding-top:50px;border-bottom:2px solid green;" id=the_basics>2. The basics</h3> <p> 2.1 To use the App and make any Purchases, you must be 18 or over. By continuing to use the App and agreeing to these Terms you are representing to us that you are 18 and we can rely on this representation. </p> <p> 2.2 The App and the Events offered on the App are only directed at people who access the App and make Purchases. We do not represent that any Events are suitable outside Delhi NCR and you should be careful to satisfy yourself of a Event's suitability to your circumstances (such as considering your travel arrangements to/from the event because unless this is expressly stated as part of the Event, it is not included as part of the Purchase). If you choose to use the App or make a Purchase outside the Delhi NCR you do so at your own initiative. </p> <p> 2.3 We grant you a limited licence to use the App to access and use our services for your own personal and non-commercial use, provided that you comply fully with these Terms (e.g. you must not re-sell the Tickets). </p> <p> 2.4 We reserve the right to prevent you using the App or making Purchases, however we will honour Purchases already made, unless you have not complied with these Terms or we are unable to because of circumstances outside our control. For more on this, please read below. </p> <h3 style="padding-top:50px;border-bottom:2px solid green;" id=access>3. Access to the App</h3> <p> 3.1 We cannot guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted or error-free operability of the App. There may be times when certain features, parts or content of the App, or the entire App, become unavailable (whether on a scheduled or unscheduled basis) or are modified, suspended or withdrawn by us, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any unavailability, modification, suspension or withdrawal of the App, or any features, parts or content of the App. </p> <p> 3.2 We may change the format and content of the App from time to time. We reserve the right to modify, change, substitute or withdraw any Events or other information on our App. You agree that your use of the App is on an 'as is' and 'as available' basis and at your sole risk. </p> <h3 style="padding-top:50px;border-bottom:2px solid green;" id=registering>4. Registering a Partiko account</h3> <p> 4.1 Why register? To put simply, if you don't register an account, you won't be able to make any Purchases. This is because you need an account in order to view your Bookings/Tickets, redeem them (if required), view your past Purchases, store your financial details and modify your preferences to name a few. We reserve the right to decline a new registration or cancel your account at any time (including if you don't provide us with a valid e-mail address that is personal to you, or if you don't provide us with a correct name and surname). </p> <p>4.2 To register an account you will need to fill out a form on the mobile app or online. You warrant that the information you input is true, complete and accurate. You will promptly inform us of any changes to such information (you can do this by updated your account details at any time). The personal information you give us is governed by our privacy policy.</p> <p>4.3 In order to register and access your account, you will need to choose a password. It is important you keep this password confidential because you are entirely responsible if you do not maintain the confidentiality of your password to a reasonably expected standard and Purchases are made via your account. Let us know as soon as you become aware there has been a breach of security and we will suspend your account. You agree that any person who you directly or implicitly permit to use your password (implicitly, for example, because you do not log out of your account and another person uses your device to make Purchases or you write your password on a noticeboard in your home and a family member then uses it to gain access to your account) is authorized to act as your agent to use the App and make Purchases via your account. You will not be responsible to pay for Purchases made after you have notified us of a password change or that security has been compromised.</p> <p>4.4 One individual user is allowed to register only one account on the App. You warrant that you will not create fraudulent accounts. You also warrant that you will not use any fraudulent activities to generate unfair Reward Credits in the App to be applied to you (for instance, you will not redeem your own invitation code with a different account of yours).</p> <h3 style="padding-top:50px;border-bottom:2px solid green;" id=what_you_are_allowed>5. What you are allowed to do</h3> <p>5.1 You may only use the App for non-commercial use and only in accordance with these Terms.

Additional terms may also apply to certain features, parts or content of the App and, where they apply, they will be displayed before you access the relevant features, parts or content.</p> <h3 style="padding-top:50px;border-bottom:2px solid green;" id=what_you_are_not_allowed>6. What you are not allowed to do</h3> <p> 6.1 Except to the extent expressly set out in these Terms, you are not allowed to: </p> <ul> <li> Store pages of the App on a server or other storage device connected to a network or create an electronic database by systematically downloading and storing all or most of the pages of the App; or</li> <li>Remove or change any content of the App or attempt to circumvent security or interfere with the proper working of the App or the servers on which it is hosted. </li></ul> <p>6.2 You must only use the App and anything available from the App for lawful purposes (complying with all applicable laws and regulations), in a responsible manner, and not in a way that might damage our name or reputation or that of any of our affiliates.</p> <p>6.3 All rights granted to you under these Terms will terminate immediately in the event that you have not followed your responsibilities as required by them (legally known as a "breach").</p> <h3 style="padding-top:50px;border-bottom:2px solid green;" id=ip_rights>7.

Review forums</h3> <p>8.1 The App may, from time to time, make message boards, news groups and/or other public forums (collectively Review Forums) available to you so that you can feedback on Events offered on the App and read the feedback submitted by other users of the App. We do not control the material submitted to Review Forums (collectively Postings), nor are Review Forums moderated. You are solely responsible for the content of your Postings as submitted by you and acknowledge that all Postings express the views of their respective authors, and not our views.</p> <p>If you participate in any Review Forum, you must:</p> <ul> <li> keep all Postings relevant to the purpose of the Review Forum and the nature of any topic; </li><li> not submit any Posting that is unlawful, threatening, abusive, libelous, pornographic, obscene, vulgar, indecent, offensive or which infringes on the intellectual property rights or other rights of any person;</li> <li> not submit any Posting that contains any viruses and/or other code that has contaminating or destructive elements;</li> <li> not submit any Posting containing any form of advertising; and</li> &lt;</ul>&gt; Not impersonate, or misrepresent an affiliation with, any person or entity. <p>You agree that, by submitting any Posting, you grant us and our affiliates a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully sub-licensable right and licence to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such Posting (in whole or part) and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media or technology, and you waive any moral rights you may have in, or to be identified as the author, of such Posting.</p> <p>Whilst we do not screen or monitor Postings, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to delete, edit or modify any Posting submitted by you and/or to close any topic, at any time without notice to you.</p> <p>Complaints about the content of any Posting must be sent to <a href=mailto:hello@Partiko.com>hello@Partiko.com</a> and must contain details of the specific Posting giving rise to the complaint</p> <h3 style="padding-top:50px;border-bottom:2px solid green;" id=external_links>9. External links</h3> <p> 9.1 The App may, from time to time, include links to external sites.

The fact that we include links to such external sites does not imply any endorsement of our association with their operators. </p> <h3 style="padding-top:50px;border-bottom:2px solid green;" id=your_personal_information>10. Your personal information</h3> <p>Use of your personal information submitted via the App is governed by our privacy policy.</p> <h3 style="padding-top:50px;border-bottom:2px solid green;" id=purchasing_tickets>11. Purchasing Tickets and Making Bookings</h3> <p>11.1 <em>Your relationship with the Merchant</em></p> <p> Except for a very small number of Events, we act as a disclosed agent for our Merchants, such as a theatre or concert promoter. This means that the contract for the Event is between you and the Merchant. In most cases this means there are likely to be additional terms and conditions which apply to your contract with the Merchant (because each Merchant has different terms relevant to the Event, for example a concert promoter will have different terms of entry than a theatre). These additional terms, if any, shall be made known to you at the time of Purchase, and/or you may <a href=#contact_us>Contact Us</a> for details. We will also provide a link to the terms in the ticket confirmation email and/or as part of the redemption instructions we send you. You shall ensure that anyone using a Booking/Ticket with a Merchant complies with those terms. </p> <p> 11.2 Where we act as agent this means that we have no contractual liability to you in respect of that particular Event. However, we may still be liable to you if we have been negligent, made a fraudulent misrepresentation or been in breach of any other relevant law. For a small number of Events we may act as principal rather than agent, which means the contract for the Event is between you and us. We will let you know where we act as principal, otherwise we will always be acting as agent. </p> <p> 11.3 It is important to note that it is the Merchant, not us, who is the seller of the Events. Therefore, if you have a complaint with the quality of the Events your complaint lies with the Merchant, not Partiko Services Private Limited, although we'd still love to hear your feedback so we can decide whether or not to continue offering events from that Merchant in the future. Contact details for the Merchant will be provided in the confirmatory email and/or in the redemption instructions we send you when you make a Purchase. We will of course use our reasonable endeavors to assist you with providing feedback to the Merchant if you so request: <a href=#contact_us>Contact us.</a> </p> <p> 11.4 Since your contract is not with us, but with a Merchant, we may pass essential booking details to that Merchant (remember, they are not a part of our company, but are third parties to whom we act as agent for). The placing of an order to purchase a Booking/Ticket will constitute consent to us passing your details for this. </p> <p>11.5 <em>Bookings/Tickets</em></p> <p>For most events you will receive an electronic Booking/Ticket or redemption instructions, since Partiko generally works on the basis of selling last-minute Event tickets (e.g. Nightlife Entries). Sometimes you will need to collect your Bookings/Tickets from the collection point where we are unable to send the electronic Booking/Ticket straight to your account. You will be notified if this is necessary and be provided with collection details, including location and times. You must take the acknowledgment of your order with you and the credit/debit card you used to make the order. If you fail to arrive at the collection point within the time specified, you will forfeit your ticket and we will not provide a refund.</p> <p> 11.6 Tickets must be used by the date of the Event shown on the Booking/Ticket, or it will no longer be valid (and you will not be entitled to a refund). </p> <p> 11.7 Tickets may be restricted to a maximum number. You will be informed of this at the point of purchase. </p> <p> 11.8 It is your responsibility to check your Tickets as if you have made a mistake it cannot always be rectified after purchase. Please check your Ticket(s) on receipt carefully and <a href=#contact_us>Contact Us</a> immediately prior to the Event if there is a mistake, or if you have not received your Ticket(s). </p> <p> 11.9 It is your responsibility to ascertain whether an Event has been cancelled or re-scheduled and the date and time of the re-scheduled Event. We will use reasonable endeavours to notify you of a cancelled or re-scheduled Event but we do not guarantee you will be informed of such cancellation before the time for the Event. </p> <p><em>11.10 Process of purchasing</em></p> <p> Tickets may be Purchased by clicking on the Events you wish to Purchase and then following the prompts that will appear on-screen. You may check and correct any input errors in your order up until the point at which you submit your order to us by clicking the "Confirm Booking" button within the App. </p> <p> 11.11 Where a concession is claimed, proof of identity and concession entitlement (for example of age or student status) may be required. </p> <p> 11.12 Once submitted, your order constitutes an offer to us to Purchase a Ticket. All orders are subject to acceptance by us. We are not obliged to accept your order and may, in our discretion, decline to accept any order. Where we accept your order, we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an email that confirms that we have accepted your order and providing details of your Ticket. Notwithstanding our acceptance, we may immediately terminate or suspend the Purchase (and suspend or void the Ticket) if subsequently your payment details are found to be invalid or lack funds by our payment provider, or we or our payment provider reasonably suspect fraudulent behaviour linked with your account. </p> <p> 11.13 Reproduction, sale, resale or trade of a Ticket is prohibited. If you attempt to do this we reserve the right to void the Ticket and cancel your account. However, we encourage you to Purchase Tickets and <span> give them as gifts! </span> </p> <p><em>11.14 Additional terms </em></p> <p> Your Booking/ticket remains the property of the Merchant and is a personal revocable licence which may be withdrawn and admission refused at any time upon refunding the printed purchase price. </p> <p> 11.15 Our Merchants may prohibit us from issuing exchanges or refunds after a Purchase is made, or for lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed tickets. It is your responsibility to keep your tickets safe, whether in digital or paper ticket formats. It is not always possible to issue duplicate tickets. If duplicates are being issued, a reasonable administration charge may be levied. </p> <p> 11.16 We may limit the amount of Bookings/Tickets you can buy to an Event. We reserve the right, on reasonable suspicion, to cancel without notice or liability to you any order for Tickets purchased over any specified limits or if we reasonably suspect fraudulent conduct in connection with the Purchase. </p> <p>11.17 A ticket shall not be used for advertising, promotions, contests or sweepstakes without the Merchant's and Partiko Services Private Limited written consent.</p> <p> Tickets are sold subject to the Event Partner's right to alter or vary the programme due to events or circumstances beyond its reasonable control without being obliged to refund monies or exchange Tickets other than in certain cases set out in<a href=#our_refunds_policy> Our refunds policy </a>. </p> <p> 11.19 The venue may refuse or revoke admission should you or your guests breach any terms and conditions of the Event or Merchant, or otherwise upon reasonable grounds. Every effort to admit latecomers will be made at a suitable break in the event, but admission cannot be guaranteed. Ticket-holders may only leave and re-enter a venue during an Event at the discretion of the management of the venue. You only have the right to a seat corresponding to that stated on the Ticket, but the Merchant reserves the right to provide alternative seats to those stated on the Ticket. </p> <h3 style="padding-top:50px;border-bottom:2px solid green;" id=price_and_payment>12. Price and payment</h3> <p>12.1 The price of Tickets is as quoted on the App from time to time. Prices include VAT, if applicable.</p> <p> Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect Purchases in respect of which we have already sent you an email confirmation. </p> <p> 12.2 Payment for all orders must be made by credit or debit card by entering such information in the Settings part in the App or as part of the booking process. </p> <p> 12.3 You should be aware that online payment transactions are subject to validation checks by your card issuer and we are not responsible if your card issuer declines to authorise payment for any reason. Please note, it is possible that your card issuer may charge you an online handling fee or processing fee. We are not responsible for this. </p> <h3 style="padding-top:50px;border-bottom:2px solid green;" id=reward_credits>13. Reward credits</h3> <p>Partiko Services Private Limited reserves the right to terminate the reward credits scheme or to change these terms and conditions, regulations, or benefits of participation, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice, even though changes may affect the number of reward credits accumulated by the user.</p> <p>13.2 Reward Credits that are not redeemed will expire three months from the date they are awarded.</p> <p>13.3 If Partiko Services Private Limited believes, in its sole discretion, that a user is abusing the reward credits (e.g. sharing on deal and voucher websites), it will revoke all reward credits awarded to that user.</p> <p>13.4 If reward credits are redeemed, and the user fails to attend the event, Partiko Services Private Limited will not refund the redeemed reward credits.</p> <p>13.5 Rewards credits earned from two or more different user's accounts cannot be combined and redeemed on the same booking.</p> <p> 13.6 Reward credits cannot be exchanged for cash and cannot be used anywhere other than on the Partiko app. </p> <p>13.7 Reward credits cannot be purchased.</p> <p> 13.8 When converting reward credit amounts between currencies, Partikos Ltd. reserves the right to determine the exchange rate to be used. </p> <h3 style="padding-top:50px;border-bottom:2px solid green;" id=our_refund_policy>14. Our Refund Policy</h3> <p> 14.1 Purchases for Tickets cannot be exchanged or refunded, except in the following circumstances: </p><p>(a) If we discover an error in the price of the Tickets you have ordered, we will use reasonable endeavors to inform you as soon as possible and allow you to either reconfirm your order at the correct price (crediting or debiting your account as applicable), or cancel your order. If you choose to cancel, you will receive a full refund from us if you've already paid. If we are unable to contact you, this will be treated as a cancellation. </p> <p>(b) If an Event is cancelled or there is a material change to the subject matter of the Ticket contract (that is what you have contracted to see) we will give you a full refund of the face value price paid or, if the face value has been reduced by the Event Partner, the discounted face value. A material change is one which, in our reasonable opinion, makes the Event materially different to what a purchaser of the Event, taken generally, could reasonably expect. For example, the use of understudies in a theatre performance does not constitute a material change. If an event is re-scheduled (and you cannot attend the re-scheduled date), we will coordinate with the Event Partner on how your ticket(s) will be treated however a refund cannot be guaranteed. </p><p> 14.2 Paying refunds </p><p>We will usually refund any money received from you using the same method originally used by you to pay for your purchase.</p> <p>You may reject a credit or refund within 30 days of receiving the credit or refund, but if you do not reject the credit or refund by notifying us within that timeframe you will be deemed to have accepted the credit or refund in full and final settlement of any and all claims, actions, demands and proceedings you may have against Partiko Services Private Limited arising out of the Ticket or Purchase for which you received the credit or refund.</p> 14.3 Your legal rights <p>Nothing in these Terms limits or takes away from your legal rights under general law, however please note that there is an exemption to the cancellation rights in respect of contracts for leisure service activities on specific dates under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations. As such, Purchases made via the App are generally non-cancellable and non-refundable, although you may be entitled to a refund in certain circumstances (see Our Refunds Policy). For more information, please contact your local Citizens Advice Bureau, phone numbers can be found on their national website at www.nacab.org.Delhi NCR. </p> <p></p> <h3 style="padding-top:50px;border-bottom:2px solid green;" id=our_service_standards>15. Our service standards</h3> <p> We warrant that we will exercise reasonable care and skill in performing our obligations under these Terms. Provided we have done so, we shall not be liable for errors or omissions, although we do, however, issue credits and refunds in limited circumstances (see section <a href=#our_refunds_policy>Our Refunds Policy</a>). In the event of an error or omission we will use reasonable endeavours to correct any errors or omissions as soon as reasonably practicable after we become aware. </p> <p> Except as expressly stated in these Terms, all warranties, conditions or other terms, whether express or implied by statute or common law or otherwise are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law. This does not stop you from exercising your legal rights under general law to the extent that we cannot lawfully exclude them, or claiming any remedies you might be entitled to under general law. </p> <h3 style="padding-top:50px;border-bottom:2px solid green;" id=our_liability>16.

Further, our liability to you for any and all losses however they arise in connection with these Terms and your use of the App (including any Purchases) is strictly limited to losses that were reasonably foreseeable. Losses are foreseeable where they could be contemplated by you and us at the time your order is accepted by us. </p> <p> 16.3 Other than as expressly described in these Terms, Partiko does not warrant and excludes all liability in respect of, or to provide, the Events for which Tickets may be redeemed, including in respect of the quality, safety, usability or any other aspect of the Events in respect of which a Ticket is or may be redeemed. We do, however, issue credits and refunds in limited circumstances (see section <a href=#our_refunds_policy>Our Refunds Policy</a>). </p> <p> 16.4 We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations that are caused by events outside our reasonable control. </p> <p> 16.5 Where videos are displayed they are intended to be purely representative of the artist or event.

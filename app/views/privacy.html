                  information (such as your name, email address, postal address and telephone number) that
                  you provide by completing forms on the App, including if you register as a user
                  of the App, subscribe to any service, upload or submit any material via the App,
                  request any information or enter into any competition or promotion we may
                  sponsor;
              </li>

                  or comments regarding the App or its content;
              </li>

              <li>
                  information from surveys that we may, from time to time, run on the App for research
                  purposes, if you choose to respond to them;

                  non-personal data. For purposes of this privacy policy, “non-personal

                  automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not
                  directly enable us to identify you.
              </li>

          <p>
              We will also use information you provide
              to us for the purposes of contacting you with information or offers regarding
              upcoming events, products, services or surveys. This shall only be done with
              your consent and our direct marketing policy which is explained in full below.

          <p>
              When you visit the App, we may
              automatically collect additional information about you, such as the type of phone
              or operating system you use and, if you came to the website, the type of
              internet browser you use and the website from which you have come to the site.
              Also, depending on whether you access Partiko on your PC or via your mobile
              device, we will collect your IP address (the unique address which identifies
              your home computer on the internet) or the unique identifier (which is linked
              to your mobile device) which are automatically recognised by our servers. You
              cannot be identified solely from this information and it is only used to assist
              us in providing an effective service on the App and to collect broad
              demographic information for aggregate use.

              The website uses cookies to store certain
              information. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your

              specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other

          <p>
              We may disclose aggregate statistics
              about visitors to the App, customers and sales in order to describe our
              services to prospective partners, advertisers, potential merchants and other
              reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics
              will include no personally identifiable information.
          </p>

          <p>
              We may disclose your personal information to any of our affiliates,
              merchants, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in providing the
              services we offer through the App, processing transactions, fulfilling
              requests for information, receiving and sending communications, updating
              marketing lists, analysing data, providing support services or in other
              tasks, from time to time. Our agents and contractors will only use your
              information to the extent necessary to perform their functions.

          <p>
              In the event that we undergo
              re-organisation or are sold to a third party, you agree that any personal
              information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or
              third party.
          </p>

          <p>
              We may disclose your personal information
              if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to
              prevent fraud or cyber crime or to protect the App or enforce the terms under
              which you transact with us or enforce the rights, property or personal safety
              of any person.

          <p>
              The App may, from time to time, make
              public forums available to its users. Any information that is disclosed
              in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when
              using these and never disclose your personal information.

          <p>
              Payment details you provide will be
              encrypted using industry standard 128 bit secure sockets layer (SSL) technology
              before they are submitted to us or our payment partners over the internet.
              You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to the
              PSP which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your
              credit/debit card information and authorising payment. We do not store your credit card number or security code
              on our servers, though it may transit through our servers as it passes to PSP. Information which you supply to our PSP is not
              within our control and is subject to PSP's own privacy policy and terms and conditions.

          <p>
              We may send you information we think you
              may find useful or which you have requested from us by push notification and/or
              (if you provide us with your e-mail address) by e-mail, including information
              about the latest or upcoming events featured on the App, provided you have
              indicated that you do not object to being contacted for these purposes and we
              will always give you the option to opt-out of receiving further e-mails or push
              notifications by following the unsubscribe instructions on any communications
              sent to you.
          </p>

          <p>
              Additionally we may allow our merchants, and if you consent by opting-in
              to receive such information and offers, other carefully selected third
              parties, to send you information directly which you may find useful regarding
              their products and services.
          </p>

          <p>
              You can tell us not to contact you with
              information regarding the products or services of third parties, or to share
              your details with third parties so that they can directly send you information
              regarding their products and services, either at the point such information is
              collected on the App (by checking the relevant box), or where you do not wish
              us to continue to use your information in this way by following the unsubscribe
              instructions on any communications sent to you.
          </p>

          <p>
              You can also exercise this right at any
              time by contacting us using the contact details at the end of this privacy
              policy.
          </p>

          <p>
              When you purchase a ticket from Partiko,
              you may at that time be offered an opportunity to purchase third party products
              or services or enter third party promotions or loyalty programmes. If you
              expressly consent to purchase those products or services or enter into the
              promotions or programmes you authorise us to share your name, e-mail address
              and, where necessary and only where you have consented for us to do so, your
              financial and billing details with that third party merchant. The use of your
              personal information will be governed by the terms of that merchant's own terms
              of supply and privacy policy, so ensure that you read the relevant terms and
              privacy policy carefully before you agree to purchase from, or participate with
              that third party merchant.

          <h3 style="padding-top:50px;border-bottom:2px solid green" id="location" >Your location data</h3>

          <p>
              In order to get the most out of our
              service and to allow us to provide you with tailored offers, we need to process
              your approximate location from time to time. The types of location data that
              will be processed are your latitude, longitude, cell tower ID, etc. Your
              location data will only be processed for as long as necessary in order for us
              to respond to your request for tailored offers. After this the data will be
              deleted. The location data may be transferred to our merchants for the purpose
              of providing you with the best offers at that time to match your
              preferences.
          </p>

          <p>
              You can choose not to allow us to process
              your approximate location at the time you connect to the app, or any time after
              that either by changing the settings on your mobile device or by contacting us
              using the contact details at the end of this privacy policy. Please note that
              if you choose not to allow us to process your location data, we will not have enough
              data in order to provide you with the full benefit of our service (e.g. a list
              of tailored offers matched to your approximate location).

          <p>
              We place great importance on the security
              of all personally identifiable information associated with our users. We
              have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse
              and alteration of personal information under our control. For example,
              our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as
              necessary and only authorised personnel have access to personal
              information. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration
              of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.
          </p>

          <p>
              You should bear in mind that submission
              of information over the internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee
              the security of information you submit via the App whilst it is in transit over
              the internet and any such submission is at your own risk.
